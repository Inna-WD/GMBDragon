            <h2 class="main-text">What are Citations and Backlink services ?</h2>
              <p>
              The definition of a citation is the mention or reference of a business’s name, address, and phone number, otherwise acronymed “NAP.” Citations are an important variable in determining the ranking of a location in Google Maps search as well as the local 3-pack shown in Google Search.
              <br>
              <br>
              Google searches for information wherever it may be found. This includes but is not limited to: local directories, social media sites, chamber of commerce sites, industry directories, press releases, news releases, and other publications. Additionally, Google uses the NAP information mentioned on your business’s website and Google My Business listing as a primary point of reference. For businesses with multiple locations, such as franchises, this underscores a key point in ensuring all of your locations are properly organized on the website.
              <br>
              <br>
              Google compares the website’s NAP information with that of surrounding sources throughout the web. This mechanism is used to assess the legitimacy of a business’ location. If there are discrepancies in a location’s citation data (i.e. inconsistent phone number or address information), it sends mixed signals to Google and rankings can suffer as a result.

            <h1 class="second-text">Backlinks</h1>
                <p>
               
                Backlinks are off-site signals that Google use to assess the credibility and authority of website. Backlinks, also known as external links or just “links,” have defining characteristics, like referring source (or referring domain)
                <br>
                <br>
                Specifically, referring domains looks at where backlinks are coming from. This includes the particular websites (and how authoritative and relevant it is), as well as where the backlink is located on the site, such as a blog post, advertising graphic, or directory listing. Backlinks from authoritative sites with a high degree of relevancy are gold for SEO.
